# Brick Breaker Game

Welcome to **Brick Breaker** â€“ a classic arcade-style game developed in C++ using graphics! This project is a part of my journey in learning computer graphics and C++ game development. The objective is to control a paddle, break all bricks, and avoid missing the ball.

## Features

- **Simple Controls**: Move the paddle left or right to bounce the ball.
- **Brick Layout**: Randomly generated brick patterns for added challenge.
- **Scoring System**: Gain points by breaking bricks, with bonus points for faster clearing.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the ball misses the paddle.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Graphics Library (`graphics.h` or similar for C++)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brick-breaker.git
   cd brick-breaker
   ```

2. Compile and run the game:
   ```bash
   g++ brick_breaker.cpp -o brick_breaker -lgraph
   ./brick_breaker
   ```

### Controls

- **Left Arrow**: Move paddle left
- **Right Arrow**: Move paddle right

## Gameplay

- Use the paddle to bounce the ball and aim to hit all the bricks.
- Missing the ball will end the game.
- Different bricks may require multiple hits to break.
